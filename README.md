    <h2>Securing Sensitive Data with Ansible Vault</h2>
    <p>
      In order to protect sensitive information, like Windows user passwords, contained within the inventory, Ansible Vault is employed. This ensures data confidentiality while allowing streamlined decryption at runtime using a single password.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, the password for Windows user authentication has been encrypted within the inventory using Ansible Vault. This encryption guarantees that the password is stored securely, preventing unauthorized access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the same password has been utilized across multiple vaults, enabling efficient decryption of all encrypted data during runtime using a single password. To execute this process, include the <code>--ask-vault-pass</code> flag when running Ansible commands, prompting you to provide the decryption password.

    <h2>Deployment Guide for Windows WinRM</h2>
    <h3>Important Note for AWS Users</h3>
    <p>
      If deploying WinRM on AWS instances, ensure robust security by following these steps to update the Administrator password securely:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Access the private key associated with your AWS instance.</li>
      <li>Open a PowerShell session on your local machine.</li>
      <li>Execute the following commands:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>
      $Password = Read-Host "Enter the new password" -AsSecureString
      $UserAccount = Get-LocalUser -Name "Administrator"
      $UserAccount | Set-LocalUser -Password $Password
    </pre>
    <p>
      This process will establish a new password for the default user, 'Administrator,' on your AWS instance, enhancing security.
    </p>
