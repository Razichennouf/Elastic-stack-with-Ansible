  <h1>üöÄ ELK Stack Deployment and Windows Agent setup Driven by Automation using <strong>Ansible</strong> üõ°Ô∏è</h1>

  <p>
    This project automates the deployment of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack on Linux servers and sets up
    security monitoring on Windows machines using Sysmon. It leverages Ansible for seamless configuration management,
    making it easy to deploy, manage, and scale ELK stack instances and Windows security settings across multiple servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>üìà <strong>ELK Stack Deployment</strong>: Automates the installation and configuration of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana on Linux servers, providing a powerful platform for log aggregation, analysis, and visualization.</li>
    <li>üîí <strong>Windows Monitoring component </strong>: Deploys Sysmon on Windows machines, a powerful system monitoring tool from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, to monitor and record security-related events for enhanced incident detection.</li>
    <li>üîê <strong>WinRM Certificate Management</strong>: Automates the creation and management of WinRM certificates on Windows machines, securing remote management channels with encrypted communication.</li>
    <li>üë§ <strong>User Management</strong>: Sets up dedicated automation users on Windows machines for executing remote tasks securely.</li>
  </ul>
    <h1>Windows WinRM Deployment Guide</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Windows WinRM Deployment Guide. This guide will walk you through the steps to enable WinRM (Windows Remote Management) on your Windows instances, allowing for secure remote access and automation.</p>

  <h2>Important Note for AWS Users</h2>
    <p>If you are deploying WinRM on AWS instances, it's crucial to statically change the Administrator password to ensure security. Follow these steps to set a new password securely:</p>
  <ol>
        <li>Start by obtaining the private key associated with your AWS instance.</li>
        <li>Open a PowerShell session on your local machine.</li>
        <li>Execute the following commands, replacing &lt;private_key_path&gt; with the path to your private key file:</li>
    </ol>
  <code>
            $Password = Read-Host "Enter the new password" -AsSecureString
            $UserAccount = Get-LocalUser -Name "Administrator"
            $UserAccount | Set-LocalUser -Password $Password
        </code>
  <p>This will set a new password for the default user 'Administrator' on your AWS instance.</p>

  <h2>Using Elastic IPs</h2>
  <p>For users deploying WinRM on AWS or similar cloud platforms, it is highly recommended to use Elastic IPs (EIPs). Elastic IPs provide a static public IP address that remains associated with your instance, even after stopping and starting it. This prevents potential conflicts and connectivity issues that may arise due to dynamic IP address changes.</p>
  <p>To assign an Elastic IP to your instance:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>Go to your cloud provider's management console.</li>
      <li>Allocate a new Elastic IP.</li>
      <li>Associate the Elastic IP with your instance, ensuring a stable and reliable connection.</li>
   </ol>
  <p>By following these steps and using Elastic IPs, you can avoid interruptions and connectivity problems when working with your WinRM-enabled Windows instances.</p>

  <p>Please note that this guide assumes a basic familiarity with Windows and PowerShell. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to seek assistance from your system administrator or support resources.</p>

  <p><strong>Caution 1:</strong> Ansible works differently on Windows and Linux systems, and the 'become' methods for privilege escalation are different. To ensure proper execution, you need to define the 'ansible_become_method' and 'ansible_become_user' variables in your inventory file as follows:</p>
<pre>
    [windows:vars]
    ansible_become_method=runas
    ansible_become_user=Administrator
    [ubuntu:vars]
    ansible_become_method=sudo
    ansible_become_user=root
</pre>
 <p><strong>Caution 2:</strong> Ansible Inventory might sometimes have an insider sensitive data so you need to <strong>encrypt</strong> the <strong>inventory</strong> and <strong>decrypt</strong> it in <strong>runtime</strong> </p>
 <pre>
     ansible-vault encrypt /path/to/inventory
     At runtime : use <strong>--ask-vault-pass</strong> to get a prompt for the password  </pre>
  <ol>
    <li>üì• Clone this repository to your local machine:</li>
    <pre>git clone https://github.com/Razichennouf/ansible_elk_winrm.git
cd ansible_elk_winrm</pre>

  <li>‚öôÔ∏è Update the inventory file (<code>inventory</code>) to include the IP addresses or hostnames of your target servers. Make sure to differentiate between Linux and Windows machines in separate groups.</li>

  <li>üîß Update the variables in the <code>inventory</code> under the clause [OS:vars]  to match your desired platforms settings.</li>

  <li>üöÄ Run the Ansible playbook to deploy the ELK stack and set up Windows render the agents ready for monitoring:</li>
  <pre>ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --ask-vault-pass </pre>

  <li>üéâ Sit back and watch as Ansible automates the entire process, from ELK stack deployment to Sysmon setup and WinRM certificate management!</li>
  </ol>
